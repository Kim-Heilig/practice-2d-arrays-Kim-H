// Tasks Challenge 1: Student Scores You need to organize scores for three students, each of whom has taken three tests. Create a 2D array named allScores where each inner array contains three test scores for a single student. 1. Write the code to create the allScores array with three inner arrays. // 2. Each inner array should contain three numeric scores of your choice.

let allScores = [[80, 90, 93], [74, 75, 76], [88, 98, 92]];


// Challenge 2: Build a Seating Grid You want to model three rows of seats in a theater with four seats per row. Create a 2D array called theaterSeating that has an outer array of three inner arrays, each inner array representing a row of four seat labels. (For instance, seat labels could be "A1", "A2", etc.)

// 1. Use nested array literals to define the structure.
// 2. Ensure each inner array has exactly four seat labels.

let seatingGrid = [["E8", "E9", "E10", "E11"], ["F8", "F9", "F10", "F11"], ["G8", "G9", "G10", "G11"]];


// Challenge 3: Form a Multi-Dimensional Contact List Create a 2D 
// array named contactsList where each inner array represents one contact’s info. For now, store three pieces of information in each inner array, such as ["Name", "Email", "Phone"]. Create two of these inner arrays in contactsList. 

// 1. Define the outer array contactsList.
// 2. Insert two inner arrays, each with three strings representing a contact’s details. 1

let contactList =[["Kim", "kim@myemail.com", "609-555-5555"], ["Mary", "mary@marysemail.com", "215-444-4444"]];
